A stock is currently trading at $100. 
You are a market maker and must quote both a bid (buy) 
and an ask (sell) price. If your goal is to make a profit 
from the spread while minimizing risk, how would you set your 
bid and ask prices?

We should set the bid price at 99.95 and ask price at 
100.05 which creates a narrow $0.10 spread that balances profit potential 
with risk management. This pricing strategy allows for consistent 
profits on each trade while remaining competitive enough 
to attract sufficient trading volume
